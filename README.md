## Background
if you do not have a crypto wallet, go ahead and create one using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). 
Out of the box, MetaMask handles public and private key creation as well as connection to the Ethereum blockchain and several test networks.

For this project, I used the Ropsten test network as my staging evironment. 
Once you create a wallet enter your public key(ex. 0xc37da9811b67ee0e0227ab564bae104d9e76d043) into the [Ropsten Eth faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/). This will que a transaction to deposit test ether into your newly created crypto wallet.

## Run locally
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
